My entry for [js13k](http://js13kgames.com/) 2015 game contest.

It's a typical "turn right, left, and jump" runner game. Unlike most of other games, submitted for the contest, this one is heavily based on CSS3. Which, it seems, led to <6k final package size.

### Controls
- turn right and left with arrow keys
- jump with space
- press any key to start
